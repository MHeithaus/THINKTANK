THINKTANK PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

*Creation of simulated brain chemistry for the purpose of interpolating correlations between EEG stimuli and brain nutrient concentration. 

*Brain chemistry simulated through use of equations via Dr. Douglas Rothman and correlative equations developed by the THINKTANK team

*Nutrient concentrations estimated via EEG readings are primary output from this system

*EEG readings compile research set from verbal stimuli and act as the only input to this system

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THINKTANK PROJECT PURPOSE:

*EEG file inputs were conducted to research the resulting brain chemistry shifts from verbal stimuli for the purpose of correlating brain nutrient concentrations to neural activity and thought. 

*The THINKTANK project creates the framework for returning neural chemical composition throughout the full brain at mid-low error from EEG data recorded using the 10-20 internation system for electrode placement
