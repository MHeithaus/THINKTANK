    Parameters
    ----------
    EEG_Welch_Spectra : Dict of Lists
        Output from EEG_Implement_Welch and contains all welch transform data from the EEG
    ElectrodeList : List
        All electrodes that took data, this is the same value input as in EEG_Implement_Welch
    Trials : Int
        Number of trials in the raw EEG dataset. This value is a return of EEG_Implement_Welch

    Returns
    -------
    WelchPoints : Dict of Lists
        The final dictionary of all CMRO2 data per 0.25 seconds via the raw EEG data.
